# linkedList

next/last step in my learning... before i feel good enough to get a job coding..
i cant wait till im one step closer to my dream, which oddly isnt coding itself.


After reading my only algorithm book thats from the 1900s, it turns out what I wrote is most Closely related to circulat list (opps I said sim pointers)...
If anyone wants to donate a 4ed of introduction to algorithms or algorithms 4th ed. I only have been using MITs open courseware (greatest ever resource) but ive learned from C++ primer, and the rest is me practicing,  never had any peers or anything, becauseI think most people's code is worse than mine..
